                                This movement began with a simple question: why do so many talented people still find doors closed to them? We realized accessibility isn’t just about ramps or signs , it’s about mindsets. <br />
                                <span className="text-custom-purple"> The Purple Movement</span> is our invitation to open those doors, together.

                                When we include, we unlock creativity, compassion, and community. This is not just a campaign. <br />
                                It’s a promise that every workplace, classroom, and website will become a place where everyone belongs.
